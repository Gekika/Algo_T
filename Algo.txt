Algo (algorithmic) trading involves creating bots that automatically buy/sell financial assets based on predefined rules — faster and more consistently than humans can.

You use data + code to create strategies like:

Momentum trading

Mean reversion

Arbitrage

News-based sentiment analysis

AI/ML prediction-based trading
