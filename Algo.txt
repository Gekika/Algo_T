1. What is Algo Trading?
Algo (algorithmic) trading involves creating bots that automatically buy/sell financial assets based on predefined rules — faster and more consistently than humans can.

You use data + code to create strategies like:

Momentum trading

Mean reversion

Arbitrage

News-based sentiment analysis

AI/ML prediction-based trading


2. Core Things You’ll Need to Learn (You already have Python!)
Knowledge Areas:
Financial markets 101 (stocks, forex, crypto, etc.)
 Technical indicators: MACD, RSI, Moving Averages, Bollinger Bands

Backtesting strategies (before risking real money)

Risk management: stop-loss, position sizing

Live trading APIs and brokers

[Optional but Powerful] Machine Learning for predictive models


3. Platforms to Use (Beginner to Advanced)
Paper/Demo Trading Platforms (Free to start):
Platform	Features	Notes
TradingView	Backtesting, scripting (Pine Script), great for visual learners	Use for strategy testing
QuantConnect	Python + C#, massive dataset access, backtesting, live trading via brokers	Ideal for pros; great for learning
Backtrader	Python-based backtesting engine	Lightweight and free
Alpaca Markets	Offers API for real trading (stocks); commission-free	Easy Python integration
Binance API	For crypto trading	Great if you want to build crypto algos

Start with TradingView + Backtrader to get your hands dirty.



4. Tools You’ll Need to Know
Python libraries:

pandas, numpy for data manipulation

matplotlib/plotly for visualization

TA-Lib / bt for technical indicators

Backtrader or Zipline for backtesting

Jupyter Notebook or VS Code for coding

GitHub to store your bots & version control



5. What to Expect & Timeline
Phase	Time	Focus
Learn basics of trading & indicators	2–3 weeks	Study TradingView, YouTube, Investopedia
Build & backtest simple strategies	1 month	Use Backtrader or QuantConnect
Run on paper/demo account	2–3 months	Don’t rush into live trading
Move to live account	After profitable paper results	Start with small capital, monitor daily

Expect:
80% of your time will be spent debugging and refining strategies.

Most strategies don’t work long-term — expect to iterate.

Even working bots can stop working when market conditions change.

Emotions are still involved — automation ≠ perfect.
